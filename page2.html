                        <p>The organization has three primary initiatives: Rescue, Adoption & Rehab. PAWS shelter is exclusively for animals in distress, particularly those involved in cases of abuse, neglect, and cruelty. The organization provides physical and behavioral rehabilitation for these rescued animals, ensuring that they are nursed back to health and ready to be put up for adoption.</p>
                        <p>PAWS has also developed programs designed to promote the humane treatment of all animals. Our 5 main programs (Clinic Neuter, KabaliCAT, Fetch and Fix, Kapon Outreach, and Kapon for All Pets) aim to end pet homelessness through spay/neuter (kapon) initiatives.</p>
                        <p>We also have other programs and those include Disaster Relief, Humane Education, Dr. Dog, Prosecution, and Lobbying.</p>
