            <article id="text">Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), was founded by Muriel Jay, a British editor who was then residing in the Philippines in 1954. PAWS is an
                animal protection NGO run entirely by volunteers. The organization's primary tasks include educating the public and spreading knowledge about issues pertaining to animal care, welfare, and control.</article>
            <article id="text">In addition to strongly opposing events like dogfights and horse races as well as the usage of wild animals for entertainment, PAWS also actively campaigns against pet neglect and animal abuse.</article>

                    <p>
                        PAWS was able to run an animal shelter for over 300 cats and dogs rescued from cruelty or neglect with the help of donations and volunteers.
                         Here, these animals are rehabilitated in the hope of finding them new homes and a second chance at a good life. Additionally, there is also a free clinic that offers the impoverished population veterinary procedures, including spay and neuter (kapon).</p>
